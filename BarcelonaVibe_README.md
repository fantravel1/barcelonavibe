## 🧠 Core Philosophy

BarcelonaVibe is **not a luxury guide**.  
It is a **youth-centered urban culture knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- surface trending venues
- cluster spots by vibe, budget, and group size
- translate slang & cultural nuance
- generate night-out and weekend itineraries

Humans are required to:
- validate accuracy & safety
- protect local neighborhoods
- avoid over-tourism amplification
- keep recommendations fresh

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

BarcelonaVibe is built around **urban lifestyle entities**.

### Core Entities
- Neighborhood
- Venue (Bar / Club / Beach Spot)
- Restaurant / Tapas Bar
- Hotel / Hostel / Apartment
- Event / Festival
- Vibe Category
- Price Tier
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links socially and geographically
- is programmatically generatable
